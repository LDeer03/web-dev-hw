13.	Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?

    A form is a combination of action, method, and identification
    Search box-text entry (usernames, real names, phone numbers, e-mails, etc.)
    User Login-
    Drop down boxes (multiple choices)
    radio checkmarks/buttons (select all-that-apply)
    password input (hidden text)
    buttons (used for submitting information and navigating to new pages)
    file uploads


14.	List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.
        text=most common input. It is where the user can type in their own response/information. Security questions, usernames, most registration forms, etc. all use text input.

        selection=allows users to choose between premeditated answers. This is used when there are only specific answers offered. Like am/pm, toppings on a food item, or possibly clothing size.

        Buttons=interactive features in web design, and can provide graphic interest as well as functionality to your links and fields. For instance, choose file button when you are uploading something or the subscribe button when you enter your email to a mailing list.

15.	Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

      This week I started my assignment folder first. I apparently did something different because although it looks the same to me, it is at the top of the folders and has a capital A in GitHub. Hopefully you can assist me with fixing that. Then I went to the website and went through the readings and exercises. For the first time I typed my answers directly into the readme file instead of onto a word document and then copy and pasting. It felt more productive to do it this way. I followed up with the work through video and clean up of my page.
