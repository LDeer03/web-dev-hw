# Assignment 08

13. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?


HTML is both exciting and frustrating. Everything was new! I came into this class without any HTML experience. I like that after a few weeks I can see it and get what is happening. But, it would take a lot more study to actually be comfortable with the process. It is very detailed and complex.


14. Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

I would say that any anxiety I may have comes from adding more detail to the basics that I barley have a grasp on. I understand that it will get more rewarding to see something artistic, but the details are intimidating.


15. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

This week, I went to moodle to see the assignment. Per usual, I started my folder, complete with the standard code in the 3 HTML files. Then I copied the questions in the readme file. After completing the website tutorials and readings, I started to piece together the past weeks into this complete assignment. Then I watched the a08 walkthrough video.
