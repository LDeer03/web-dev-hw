1. How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have?

          There is only one head and one body in each page.

  **1a.** How are these elements different, or what role do they play?

          The <head> contains high level information about the site and always comes first in the root element. It is considered to hold the thoughts of the page.

          The <body> is the meat and potatoes of a page. This is data that is rendered by the browser and displayed on you computer.

2. Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.

          Structural embeds the information about the structure of a document and includes the heading, paragraphs, breaks, and lists. They are crucial to authoring web content. Semantic is used to reinforce the meaning of the information and includes bold, quotations, links, strike thru, definitions, etc.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

          My work cycle has been consistent for the past few weeks. I read the assignment and get my folders built in atom. I then get my read me questions recorded and read the website pages. I answer the read me questions as I am reading the homework. When that is completed I move on to the work through video and start building my page. I start and stop the video often to incorporate the assignment and double check my code. I then launch my page and start tweaking. It is frustrating and exciting at the same time.
