13. Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

Universal selector is used to style EVERY element on a page. It is represented in the head by the * and stands for all. This is a good way to add a font or page background color.

Element selector affects specific types of elements. You signify by using the elements name in the head like h1 or p. This is good for making something stand out or to change a portion of the page.

Classes are part of the style element. They are identified with a . and are a great way to select elements that serve the same function. For instance, blocked of sections or instruction.

An id identifies a style rule for a specific element, similar to a class. Ids are identified by a # and are effective when working with multiple items that are similar but have slight differences.





14. Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.

I choose the 80's so bright colorful, neon hues. I was fortunate that you also chose this color palette in the tutorial video, so I had a little confidence in the pink code. Then I used the color picker and chose colors that complimented the pink.

orange #FFBB37/ 255, 187, 55


pink  #FF377B/ 255,55,123


purple #853AFC/ 133, 58, 252


green #37FF57/ 55, 255, 87


yellow #DFFF37/ 223, 255, 55


blue #3AB1FC/58, 177, 252





15. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

I followed a different approach this week, and I am not sure I will do it again. I am not sure if I mixed it up because of our break, or what is happening in our world, but regardless I did it differently.

Typically I watch your video last and there are always things I decide to tweak or add after watching it. So, this week I watched it first. Because of this, I was less efficient in building my page.

I had your example built and launched before I read the assignment or looked at the learning material. Then I felt behind and ahead at the same time. I don't feel like I grasped the differences in style, in the learning you start in HTML and move to CSS. I didn't figure that out at first and started to get confused. I feel I have figured it out now, but it took longer than my regular process.
