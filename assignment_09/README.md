13. Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

Universal selector is used to style EVERY element on a page. It is represented in the head by the * and stands for all. This is a good way to add a font or page background color.

Element selector affects specific types of elements. You signify by using the elements name in the head like h1 or p. This is good for making something stand out or to change a portion of the page.

Classes are part of the style element. They are identified with a . and are a great way to select elements that serve the same function. For instance, blocked of sections or instruction.

An id identifies a style rule for a specific element, similar to a class. Ids are identified by a # and are effective when working with multiple items that are similar but have slight differences.



14. Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.

I choose the 80's so I chose bright colorful, neon hues. I was fortunate that you also chose this color palette in the tutorial video so I got a little confidence in the code.
