      <h1> The 80's </h1>
      <p> The 1980s were both awesome and horrible at the same time. If you lived through them, you know what I mean. <br> Everything was neon and ugly. Color combinations were the worst. Fashion was weird, music was over-digitized and commercialism consumed everyone.The Cold War ended, which was great. The Berlin Wall fell. Jazzercize was the place to be.
