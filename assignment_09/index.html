      <h1> The 80's </h1>
      <p> The 1980's were both awesome and horrible at the same time. <br> A decade of contradiction. If you lived through them, you know what I mean. <br> Everything was neon. Fashion was both baggy and tight. Color combinations were tottaly tubular. <br> Music was over-digitized, yet completely rad. Big ballads and dance music shared the radio waves and competed on MTV. <br> The Cold War ended. The Berlin Wall fell. But, Jazzercize was the place to be.
