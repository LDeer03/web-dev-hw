6.	Briefly describe one way how data travels on the internet.

    One-way data travels on the internet is by using light waves through fiber optic cables. The cables are running everywhere on the planet and multiple waves can be sent simultaneously in one cable.

7.	What is the relationship between an IP address and the DNS?
    IP or internet protocol acts as a 32 bit address. First is the equivalent to the country, then the region, followed by the sub region, and finally the device. DNS, or domain naming system, is the way we find IP addresses. For instance, a domain name is whatever youâ€™re looking for with .org, .net, .com etc with it. Like facebook.com. But, the IP address is a group of numbers that are much harder to remember, for facebook it is  69.63. 176.13. 69.63. The DNS helps users find the correct IP addresses.
