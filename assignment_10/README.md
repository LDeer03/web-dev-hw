13. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?


System fonts are already installed on your local device. They are available to you but not necessarily the web. Due to licensing they must be exported as images. Because of this they should be used sparingly.


Web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server. This is what the majority of website use. They require certain elements to appear and should consider browser compatibility, rendering speeds, and availability.


Web-safe fonts are dependable fonts for developers to use. Arial, Georgia, Impact, Times New Roman, Verdana, and Lucida are a few examples. These increase load time because they are found on both PC and Mac as system fonts.




14. What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?

They will allow your site to have content if a font is either taking to long to load or cannot be found.




15. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

I went back to my old format. Read assignment. Start Atom files. Read learning material while creating my page. Watch the video. Tweak assignment. This system definitely works well for me. I feel like I grasp the concepts better.

I can say that it is harder to stay motivated while being sheltered in place. I am more productive when I am busy.
