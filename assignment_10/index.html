    <h2>By: Shel Silverstein</h2>

  <div class="text">
      <p class="p1">
                      Once there was a tree....
                and she loved a little boy.
                And everyday the boy would come
                and he would gather her leaves
                and make them into crowns
                and play king of the forest.
                He would climb up her trunk
                and swing from her branches
                and eat apples.
                And they would play hide-and-go-seek.
                And when he was tired,
                he would sleep in her shade.
                And the boy loved the tree....
                very much.
                And the tree was happy.
      </p>

      <p class="p2">
                        But time went by.
                And the boy grew older.
                And the tree was often alone.
                Then one day the boy came to the tree
                and the tree said, "Come, Boy, come and
                climb up my trunk and swing from my
                branches and eat apples and play in my
                shade and be happy."
                "I am too big to climb and play" said
                the boy.
                "I want to buy things and have fun.
                I want some money?"
                "I'm sorry," said the tree, "but I
                have no money.
                I have only leaves and apples.
                Take my apples, Boy, and sell them in
                the city. Then you will have money and
                you will be happy."
                And so the boy climbed up the
                tree and gathered her apples
                and carried them away.
                And the tree was happy.
                But the boy stayed away for a long time....
                and the tree was sad.

      </p>

      <p class="p3">
                        And then one day the boy came back
                and the tree shook with joy <br>
                and she said, "Come, Boy, climb up my trunk
                and swing from my branches and be happy."
                "I am too busy to climb trees," said the boy.
                "I want a house to keep me warm," he said.
                "I want a wife and I want children,
                and so I need a house.
                Can you give me a house ?"
                " I have no house," said the tree.
                "The forest is my house,
                but you may cut off
                my branches and build a
                house. Then you will be happy."
                And so the boy cut off her branches
                and carried them away
                to build his house.
                And the tree was happy.

      </p>

      <p class="p4">
                But the boy stayed away for a long time.
                And when he came back,
                the tree was so happy
                she could hardly speak.
                "Come, Boy," she whispered,
                "come and play."
                "I am too old and sad to play,"
                said the boy.
                "I want a boat that will
                take me far away from here.
                Can you give me a boat?"
                "Cut down my trunk
                and make a boat," said the tree.
                "Then you can sail away...
                and be happy."
                And so the boy cut down her trunk
                and made a boat and sailed away.
                And the tree was happy
                ... but not really.

      </p>

      <p class="p5">

                And after a long time
                the boy came back again.
                "I am sorry, Boy,"
                said the tree," but I have nothing
                left to give you -
                My apples are gone."
                "My teeth are too weak
                for apples," said the boy.
                "My branches are gone,"
                said the tree. " You
                cannot swing on them - "
                "I am too old to swing
                on branches," said the boy.
                "My trunk is gone, " said the tree.
                "You cannot climb - "
                "I am too tired to climb" said the boy.
                "I am sorry," sighed the tree.
                "I wish that I could give you something....
                but I have nothing left.
                I am just an old stump.
                I am sorry...."
                "I don't need very much now," said the boy.
                "just a quiet place to sit and rest.
                I am very tired."
                "Well," said the tree, straightening
                herself up as much as she could,
                "well, an old stump is good for sitting and resting
                Come, Boy, sit down. Sit down and rest."
                And the boy did.
                And the tree was happy.
