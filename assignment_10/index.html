    <h2>By: Shel Silverstein</h2>

  <div class="text">
      <p class="p1">
                      Once there was a tree....
                and she loved a little boy.<br>
                And everyday the boy would come
                and he would gather her leaves
                and make them into crowns
                and play king of the forest.<br>
                He would climb up her trunk
                and swing from her branches
                and eat apples.<br>
                And they would play hide-and-go-seek.<br>
                And when he was tired,
                he would sleep in her shade.<br>
                And the boy loved the tree....
                very much.<br>
                And the tree was happy.<br>
      </p>
                  <br>
      <p class="p2">
                        But time went by.
                And the boy grew older.<br>
                And the tree was often alone.<br>
                Then one day the boy came to the tree
                and the tree said, <br>"Come, Boy, come and
                climb up my trunk and swing from my
                branches and eat apples and play in my
                shade and be happy."<br>
                "I am too big to climb and play" said
                the boy.
                "I want to buy things and have fun.
                I want some money?"<br>
                "I'm sorry," said the tree, "but I
                have no money.
                I have only leaves and apples.
                Take my apples, Boy, and sell them in
                the city. Then you will have money and
                you will be happy."<br>
                And so the boy climbed up the
                tree and gathered her apples
                and carried them away.<br>
                And the tree was happy.<br>
                But the boy stayed away for a long time....
                and the tree was sad.<br>

      </p>

      <p class="p3">
                        And then one day the boy came back
                and the tree shook with joy <br>
                and she said, "Come, Boy, climb up my trunk
                and swing from my branches and be happy."<br>
                "I am too busy to climb trees," said the boy.
                "I want a house to keep me warm," he said.
                "I want a wife and I want children,
                and so I need a house.
                Can you give me a house ?"<br>
                "I have no house," said the tree.
                "The forest is my house,
                but you may cut off
                my branches and build a
                house. Then you will be happy."<br>
                And so the boy cut off her branches
                and carried them away
                to build his house.<br>
                And the tree was happy.<br>

      </p>

      <p class="p4">
                But the boy stayed away for a long time.
                And when he came back,
                the tree was so happy
                she could hardly speak.<br>
                "Come, Boy," she whispered,
                "come and play."<br>
                "I am too old and sad to play,
                said the boy.
                "I want a boat that will
                take me far away from here.
                Can you give me a boat?"<br>
                "Cut down my trunk
                and make a boat," said the tree.
                "Then you can sail away...
                and be happy."<br>
                And so the boy cut down her trunk
                and made a boat and sailed away.
                And the tree was happy<br>
                ... but not really.<br>

      </p>

      <p class="p5">

                And after a long time
                the boy came back again.<br>
                "I am sorry, Boy,"
                said the tree, "but I have nothing
                left to give you -
                My apples are gone.<br>
                "My teeth are too weak
                for apples," said the boy.<br>
                "My branches are gone,"
                said the tree. "You
                cannot swing on them - "<br>
                "I am too old to swing
                on branches," said the boy.<br>
                "My trunk is gone, " said the tree.
                "You cannot climb -"<br>
                "I am too tired to climb" said the boy.<br>
                "I am sorry," sighed the tree.
                "I wish that I could give you something....
                but I have nothing left.
                I am just an old stump.
                I am sorry...."<br>
                "I don't need very much now," said the boy.
                "just a quiet place to sit and rest.
                I am very tired."<br>
                "Well," said the tree, straightening
                herself up as much as she could,
                "well, an old stump is good for sitting and resting.
                Come, Boy, sit down. Sit down and rest."<br>
                And the boy did.<br>
                And the tree was happy.<br>
