    <h3> Keep Healthy and Sane</h3>
    <p> As the new reality of living through a pandemic sets in, people are    searching to temper the deluge of medical information and intimidating headlines with quarantine entertainment. <br><br>
    While typical stress relief activities may be harder to orchestrate during a time of mass social distancing and sheltering in place, there are a number of ways to steer clear of coronavirus news and enjoy the time at home. <br><br>
    Between new Netflix series, mass gaming movements, and quarantine social media content, you can find small ways to make the most of social distancing. <br><br>
    The novel coronavirus is no longer culturally novel — it's been several weeks since schools and non-essential workplaces began to close down, and many are settling into what's become a new normal of social distancing. In lieu of face-to-face contact, people around the world have developed new ways to stay connected and still have fun, even while adhering to public health guidelines. <br><br>
    From bingeing Netflix series like "Tiger King" to celebrating birthdays with family to getting really passionate about baking bread, we've compiled some suggestions on how to entertain yourself — and still hang out with your friends — while quarantined.<br><br>
    Virtual worlds provide a unique opportunity to hang out with your friends while still maintaining proper social distance. Recent release "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" is a hot topic at the moment, with plenty of gamers causing mischief while visiting their friends' islands via Nintendo Switch Online. Others are using the game to celebrate milestones, holding weddings and graduations within the game itself after they were canceled in the real world. Turning towards games like the nostalgia-laced "Club Penguin" can help relieve stress and mitigate anxiety while distancing as well.<br><br>
    It might be a good time to get into the Minecraft renaissance as well, or pick up teenage favorite Roblox — even if high schools aren't actually planning to hold graduation ceremonies in the game.<br><br>
    Of course, you don't have to focus on video games alone — Business Insider Associate Editor Juliana Kaplan played an online version of popular board game Settlers of Catan while chatting with friends over a Zoom call.<br><br>
    There are plenty of other games that you can play online as well, ranging from classics like UNO! or Monopoly to fun, vulgar games to play with friends like Cards Against Humanity to mobile games like "Mario Kart Tour." Feel free to get back into classics like "Words With Friends" or "Scattergories" as well.<br><br>
