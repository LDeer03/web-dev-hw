    <p> As the new reality of living through a pandemic sets in, people are    searching to temper the deluge of medical information and intimidating headlines with quarantine entertainment. <br>
    While typical stress relief activities may be harder to orchestrate during a time of mass social distancing and sheltering in place, there are a number of ways to steer clear of coronavirus news and enjoy the time at home. <br>
    Between new Netflix series, mass gaming movements, and quarantine social media content, you can find small ways to make the most of social distancing. <br>
    The novel coronavirus is no longer culturally novel — it's been several weeks since schools and non-essential workplaces began to close down, and many are settling into what's become a new normal of social distancing. In lieu of face-to-face contact, people around the world have developed new ways to stay connected and still have fun, even while adhering to public health guidelines. <br>
    From bingeing Netflix series like "Tiger King" to celebrating birthdays with family to getting really passionate about baking bread, we've compiled some suggestions on how to entertain yourself — and still hang out with your friends — while quarantined.<br>
