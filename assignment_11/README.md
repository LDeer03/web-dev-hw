13. What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?


Padding is the space between the inner content of the element and the element itself. It can help to control the space between elements and also change the size of individual boxes. Can be absolute or relative.


Margins are the space between the element and other elements. Can be absolute or relative.


A border is a visual styling tool not a space management tool. Solid, dashed, dotted, doubled, inset, outset, groove, ridge, and hidden are examples. They can be separately colored.

15. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

I have developed a system that works for me and I am sticking to it. I read the assignment, set up the basics in Atom, read the material while answering the README questions. This week I was also paying attention to what designs/positioning I like to build my page. Then I did my sketch. Just when I thought things were going smooth, I hit a snag. I would think I was close and then everything would shift. Between positioning code mistakes and update speed, this was the most time consuming project yet.
