13. Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?

A better question is what didn't I learn? Being completely new to HTML, CSS, and the ways to use them, I was on a completely vertical learning curve. GitHub, repositories, Classes, id's, all of it was new. Version control is something I am familiar with but not in this format.



14. Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?

Again, everything was new. But, I enjoyed the process. Web development is exciting and frustrating. It is thrilling to see everything work and come together but it is infuriating when it doesn't. Where are you missing a semi colon or carrot? What didn't you copy correctly? So tedious!! As far as color and fonts, applying them was a new technique but we have used the concepts in many of our media arts classes.



15. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

I started with the element that stumped me on the last assignment and then built from there. The drop down menu. I then cut and pasted HTML and CSS from different parts of other assignments that I felt worked. Unfortunately, the fonts stumped me this week. There was no reason for the underline or color change on active lines.
