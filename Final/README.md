13. Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?

A better question is what didn't I learn? Being completely new to HTML, CSS, and the ways to use them, I was on a completely vertical learning curve. GitHub, repositories, Classes, id's, all of it was new. Version control is something I am familiar with but not in this format. I feel I would improve with my summary notes with more practice and more users.



14. Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?

Again, everything was new. But, I enjoyed the process. Web development is exciting and frustrating. It is thrilling to see everything work and come together but it is infuriating when it doesn't. Where are you missing a semi colon or carrot? What didn't you copy correctly? Why don't you work!? All questions I asked frequently. So tedious!! As far as color and fonts, applying them was a new technique but we have used the concepts in many of our media arts classes. As my industry is completely shut down for at least a year, this is a field I could see myself interested in. But, I would need a lot more understanding and practice.



15. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

I started with the element that stumped me on the last assignment and then built from there. The drop down menu. I then cut and pasted HTML and CSS from different parts of other assignments that I felt worked. Updated the colors and fonts to build my vision. Unfortunately, the fonts stumped me for a time period this week. Well I thought it was the fonts.


There was no reason for all of my text to be underlined or for color to change on active lines. I spent days on it and finally sent an email. Then I realized that I did not close my social media links. Problem solved. All of my text was hyperlinked to YouTube. As I said exciting and frustrating!! So tedious, but fun. Thank you for another great semester. FYI your tutorial videos and website lessons were great!! Much easier to use and understand than the text book. You are an excellent instructor!
