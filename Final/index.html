      <h2>Year Round Garden Planner: How To Create A Four Season Garden</h2>
        <img src="./images/garden-for-all-seasons.jpg" width="" height="" alt="garden-for-all-seasons" title="garden-for-all-seasons" / >

        <p> While planting a garden is not an overly taxing chore, planning for a four-season garden takes a little more thinking and organizing. Designing year-round gardens ensures that your home is surrounded by color and interest through all four seasons. </p><br>

      <h2>Year-Round Garden Planner</h2>
        <p>  Before beginning your garden, create a year-round garden planner where you can identify the plants that will bloom each season in your garden. A planner will not only help you keep track of what you have planted, but it will also allow you to add garden notes or other thoughts as well as pictures. </p> <br>

      <h2>How to Create a Four-Season Garden</h2>
        <p>Designing year-round gardens simply begins with choosing appropriate plants for your region [1]. Depending on where you live, you can use any combination of perennials, annuals and container plantings for these all-season flower gardens. <br>

        Although it is somewhat easier for gardeners in the South to accomplish a variety of color all season long, northerly gardeners may achieve interest and color year round as well by implementing plants with interesting foliage or other features.<br>

        The key to a successful year-round garden is to know which species do best in your region and understand when their display is greatest. To create balance in your four-season garden, it is best to choose at least two types of plants that will flower together during each season.</p> <br>

        <h2>Four-Season Container Gardens</h2>
          <p>In addition to all-season flower garden, you can also choose to create four-season container gardens. These are a great alternative for those living in cooler climates. Containers [2] are also an excellent way to add color to your garden all year long.<br>

          Containers offer a flexible solution for using annuals or can be a great home for attractive evergreen or perennial plants. Spring-blooming bulbs [3] can be mixed with summer and fall-blooming plants [4] in a mixed container display that provides color well into the cool season in most areas.<br>

          Four-season container gardens can also provide the option of changing your plantings with each new season.
