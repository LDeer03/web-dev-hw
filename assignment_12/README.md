13. Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?


      My client is a local non profit trying to spread heart back into their community. Focusing on heart and family, they wanted to make an interactive, user friendly site to take advantage of the family time this quarantine has provided for us. We went with a Christmas theme because not only did they love the idea of having the Christmas Spirit year round, but also the kids are used to being home at Christmas so it was an attempt to add normalcy to their current situation.


14. What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?

Block: Turns inline elements into block elements. Good to create vertical navigation bars out of lists.

Inline: forces elements to act like inline elements. Can only change the horizontal properties.

Inline-block: Respects horizontal and vertical properties. Must set width.


15. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

This week was a little different of a process because there was so much review. I read the assignment, built and launched the site, read the material, and then watched the video. I had to change quite after watching the video. I don't remember seeing anything about a font or menu css.

After attempting to add the new css files, my entire site fell apart. Unfortunately I have been sick this week, so in the time I have left before the deadline, I can not trouble shoot what happened. I restored my site to before the additions and take my chances. As you know, this is not the work I like to turn in. I tried several different ways to add the drop down menu but was unable to. I decided it was better to have a page that looked visually correct than to have a partial tool bar. I will try again if there is time and I feel better. Thank you for teaching us so much!!
