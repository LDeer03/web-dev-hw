13.	Visit a site using The Wayback Machine, looking at a snapshot at least 10 years old. Where did you go? What did it look like? How has it changed?
I looked at my old business, On Center Performing Arts (OCPA). www.oncenter.biz Most of the media doesn’t exit any longer but it was fun to see how the website evolved over the thirteen years it was online. It started with very little layout or navigation and evolved into a fast loading, easy to navigate website. It was always photo based so it looks a little barren but it reminds me what it was. I sold OCPA to someone else in December of 2018 and apparently they are no longer using this site.

14.	Summarize your experience with the GIT Module. What did you learn? What was difficult, easy, or still misunderstood?
I am actually enjoying the GIT process. Adding the poem and more personal interest made it more fun. There are still a few things confusing me. For instance, why do I keep getting a “>”on the page. Maybe because I’m working on a PC? Not sure. Also, I am seeing that a Mac is definitely easier to use. Your videos are much simpler than what I must do. Especially a screen shot. I may be investing soon in my first Mac.

15.	An embedded image of your screenshot using its relative URL.
