13. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

      A div and span are elements. Ids, and classes are attributes of them. They are used to specifically identify and group the elements. You can have multiple span elements inside a div element and all contain classes and ids as identifiers.


14. What is "alt text," and why do we use it?

      Alternative text, or alt text, is the description of an image. It is used for a screen reader to explain to the visually impaired what the image is. It is also useful for a browser that will not load the image.


15. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

      Similarly to past weeks, I went to moodle to see the assignment. I started my folder, complete with the index and readme files. Then I started the website learning, filling in my readme answers as I learned them. I also updated atom as I learned an element. After completing the website tutorials and readings, I watched the a07 walkthrough video.

      I could not get the poster to show up on my Media arts logo video. I rewrote and rechecked the code several times and it still didn't work.
