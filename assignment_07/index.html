          <h1>Lyrics</h1>
            <hr><pre>
              I was dreamin' when I wrote this
              Forgive me if it goes astray
              But when I woke up this mornin'
              Could've sworn it was judgment day
              The sky was all purple
              There were people runnin' everywhere
              Tryin' to run from the destruction
              You know I didn't even care
              Say say
              Two-thousand-zero-zero party over
              Oops out of time
              So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
              War is all around us, my mind says prepare to fight
              So if I gotta die I'm gonna listen to my body tonight
              Yeah
              They say two-thousand-zero-zero party over
              Oops out of time
              So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
              Yeah, Yeah
              Lemme tell ya something
              If you didn't come to party
              Don't bother knockin' on my door
              I got a lion in my pocket
              And baby he's ready to roar
              Yeah, yeah
              Everybody's got a bomb
              We could all die any day
              Ooow
              But before I'll let that happen
              I'll dance my life away
              Oh, they say
              Two thousand-zero-zero-party over
              Oops out of time
              We're runnin' outta time
              (Tonight I'm gonna)
              So tonight we gonna
              (Party like it's 1999)

              Say it 1 more time
              Two-thousand-zero-zero party over oops
              Out of time
              No, no (Tonight I'm gonna)

              That's right, c'mon, sing the song (Party)
              That's right (Party)
              Got a lion in my pocket mama, say (Party)
              Oh, and he's ready to roar (Party)
