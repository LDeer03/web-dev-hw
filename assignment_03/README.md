13.	Very briefly detail how browsers function. List any browsers you currently use to surf - or even develop for - the web.

First the user interface represents the page/panel. Then the rendering engine becomes the “painter” of the viewed page using the HTML and CSS to represent the structure and color. Third, the browser engine acts as a marshal between the user interface, the rendering engine and servers. In the fourth step the browser communicates with the network to receive content. The fifth step is applying interactive logic and functionality by using a programming language to interpret JavaScript. Finally, the data storage uses cookies to remember important identifying data. Chrome is the browser I prefer.

14.	What is a markup language? Describe one commonly used in development.

Markdown files encourage the writer to focus on content and structure. HTML is the most common and uses a markup language. It is used to define, process, and present text. It is the written code for formatting.
